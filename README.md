## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository

# Install with Poetry (recommended)
poetry install

poetry run playwright install

# Or install with pip in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
playwright install
```

## Configuration

MyCoder-Py requires API keys to function with LLM providers. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
# Configure Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
# For Ollama, you can set the base URL (defaults to http://localhost:11434)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run with a prompt
mycoder "Implement a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers"

# Run in interactive mode
mycoder -i

# Read prompt from a file
mycoder -f prompt.txt

# Select a specific model
mycoder --model claude-3-opus-20240229 "Create a REST API with FastAPI"

# Use Ollama with a specific model
mycoder --provider ollama --model llama3 "Explain how to use virtual environments in Python"
```
