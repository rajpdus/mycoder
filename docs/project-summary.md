# MyCoder-Py Project Summary

## Overview

MyCoder-Py is a Python implementation of an AI-powered coding assistant. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide intelligent assistance for programming tasks.

## Key Components

### 1. LLM Provider System

The LLM Provider system enables communication with various language model APIs:

- **Base Abstractions**:
  - `LLMProvider` abstract class defines the interface
  - Message models for structured communication
  - Tool call representation for function calling

- **Implementations**:
  - OpenAI provider for GPT models
  - (Future) Anthropic provider for Claude models
  - (Future) Ollama provider for local models

### 2. Tool System

The Tool system provides capabilities for the AI agent to interact with the external world:

- **Base Abstractions**:
  - `Tool` abstract class for defining tools
  - Pydantic models for tool arguments and results
  - `ToolManager` for managing tool registration and execution

- **Tool Categories**:
  - File Operations (read, write, list)
  - Shell Commands (run commands)
  - User Interaction (prompts, messages)

### 3. Command Line Interface

The CLI provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with MyCoder:

- Main command for executing prompts
- Interactive mode for continuous operation
- Configurable options via command-line flags

### 4. Configuration System

A comprehensive configuration system that handles:

- Environment variables via `.env` files
- Command-line overrides
- Defaults appropriate for common use cases
